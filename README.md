## Features

- Basic ray tracing algorithm
- Support for spheres and planes
- Diffuse and specular lighting
- Shadows and reflections
- Configurable scene setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)

### Installation
1. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

2. Run the project:
